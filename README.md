# Genshin web app

## What am I going to build

###Start up

I want to start with something simple, let's create a couple of things;

- [X] I want to grab data from the genshin api and store in my database

- [X] and display that in a cool way,


After that I want to design the homepage, and display all the characters in the /characters route

Functionalities:

### Auth
- [X] User can make an account

- [x] User can edit account (details)

- [x] User can remove account (details)

### Profile actions
- [x] User can add characters they own to their list and keep track of how many constellations they have

- [x] User can edit characters they own to their list and keep track of how many constellations they have

- [x] User can remove characters they own

- [X] Have a list of all the characters you own 

- [] See level resource material required for each ascension for each character

- [] Wish generator
  - Version 1: Infinite primo's for infinite wishes (test phase)
  - Version 2:

    - You get primo's for completing "tasks", for example 10 primos for having 5 characters in your character list.
    - You get primo's for declaring that you defeated a certain amount of enemies.
    - Adventure rank 5,10,15,20,25,30,... you get +10 primos

- [] Keep track of how many enemies you've encountered, and then have an option to check if you killed them. You can also write down if they drop good loot

- [] Music player?

### Locations

- [] User can travel between different locations(pages) in the world of Genshin impact
- [] User can see the local food and certain recipes that are bound to that location

### Search

- [] User can search for characters

- [] User can filter and search on character traits (elements, occupation etc.)


## Ideas?:
Ui with more animations especially the locations eventually
Layout revamp for the homepage, could look more appealing

###Known bugs

When selecting a character the icon does not show up.
In the character list some icons do not show up.
