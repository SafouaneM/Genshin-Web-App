# Genshin web app

### What am I going to build

I want to start with something simple, let's create a couple of things;

- [X] I want to grab data from the genshin api and store in my database

- [X] and display that in a cool way,



After that I want to design the homepage, and display all the characters in the /characters route

Functionalities:

- [X] User can make an account

- [] User can update/remove account (details)

- [] Have a list of all the characters you own and keep track of how many constellations you have

- [] Level resource material required for each ascension for each character

- [] Wish generator

- [] User can look for characters

- [] User can filter on character traits (elements, occupation etc.)

- [] Keep track of how many enemies you've encountered, and then have an option to check if you killed them. You can also write down if they drop good loot

- [] Music player?
